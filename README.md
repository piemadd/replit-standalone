# Replit Standalone

## About
Replit standalone was purposemade to be a high-performace desktop app version of Replit. Inspired by [replit-desktop](https://github.com/replit-discord/replit-desktop), the goal is to allow for plugin functionality to Replit while modifying absolutely no source, with the exception of extensions, therefore increasing security and decreasing bloat.
